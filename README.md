# Data-Structures-Project

An Ed. project implemented in Unity that aims to help students understand Data Structures by visualizing them in a 3D environment.

This project is an Unity project, therefore you’ll need to have Unity installed to check it; there’s still not a build at the moment since it’s in progress.

Current Data Structures implemented:

* Dynamic Array 
  Functionality
  1. An add method implemented showing how an object is added to the array. (Index/No-index)
  2. A remove method implemented showing how an object is removed from an array. (Index/No-index)
  3. A Re-size method  that re-sizes the array when the current size limit of the array is reached.

* Graph (In progress)
  Functionality
  1. A create method that initializes the nodes of the graph and displays them.
  2. A createArc method that links two nodes. (Only works for the first two)
